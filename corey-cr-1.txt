Overall feedback

There are just a few changes i would implement to make the program morw user friendly.
- Write code to populate partial matches when searching for product #
-Avoid shorthand such as qty from the user end to avoid confusion
-You've included try-catch blocks to handle potential errors, which is a good practice for robustness.
However, it would be helpful to provide more specific error messages or log information for debugging.
