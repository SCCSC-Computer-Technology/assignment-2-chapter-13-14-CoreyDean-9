Code Review for Corey


I was not able to run the program because of a 'downgrade' path, so I could not test the functionalities of the form and buttons, but I was able to look and review the Form1.cs and I would say it is organized and I liked how he put the controls group boxes to help users visualize what text box and buttons are for what searches and filters. In the back end of his code, I noticed his use of try-catches and I would note on using a more informative message to help prevent the user from making the same mistake, for example changing 'Error!' to 'Requires a string input' or 'Requires an integer input'.

His code is well documented and is readable, his use of comments allows team members or reviewers to understand what process he wanted to complete. I noticed the use of LINQ queries, and I would sugguest creating a method or factoring out repitive code to reduce redundancy. Overall, the code was well structured and easy to follow, his logic for each was click handler was clear and executable.
